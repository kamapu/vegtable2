# vegtables2

This is a package with functions for the internal use and adapted to own
purposes.
The functions included here are extensions to `taxlist`
([https://github.com/kamapu/taxlist]()) and `vegtables`
([https://github.com/kamapu/vegtables]()) and its functions may not work with
any database.

## Updating to the last version of vegtables
The very first step is to install the package
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) and dependencies.
Then you just need to execute following commands in your R-session:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/vegtables2")
```
